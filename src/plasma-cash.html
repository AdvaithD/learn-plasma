            <h2 id="plasma-cash">Introduction</h2>
            <p class="lead-2">Plasma Cash is an implementation of Plasma that utilizes <b>non-fungible</b> tokens. For this article, we assume that the Plasma chain operates on a Proof of Authority consensus mechanism with an operator node as the authority.</p>

            <hr class="hr-dash my-7">

            <h3 id="non-fungibility">Non-fungibility</h3>

			<p><span>The key concept in Plasma Cash is the ability to tokenize a non-fungible asset and transact or interact with it on the Plasma chain. An obvious benefit is that a participant only has to track transactions concerning their own tokens.
            </span></p>

            <hr class="hr-dash my-7">

            <h3 id="how-it-works">How It Works</h3>
            <p>The smart contract holds a mapping where a unique TokenID is mapped to the balance of each deposit. In this way, the Plasma Chain is basically holding a tokenized form of the non-fungible asset being deposited on the main chain.</p>

            <p>Here is a step-by-step example:<p>
            <ol>
                <li><span>Make a deposit to the smart contract on the Ethereum root chain</span></li>

                <li><span>The smart contract creates a mapping for a unique TokenID → deposit amount</span></li>

                <li><span>A token with the corresponding TokenID is created on the Plasma chain</span></li>

            </ol>
            <p>When a transaction is made with a token, the state of the token is then updated and reflected in the next block. The Merkle root of each block is always committed to the root chain, as with other Plasma implementations.</p>

            <p>Example: Imagine we have a Plasma Cash implementation for tracking art pieces. Each art piece is registered as a token on the main contract. On the Plasma Chain, the art piece can have data stating that it belongs to owner A. Owner A could then choose to create a transaction transferring ownership to Owner B. This transaction would then be included in the next block by the operator. In the next block, the token representing this art piece would just state that Owner B is the owner.</p>

            <hr class="hr-dash my-7">

            <h3 id="data-structure">Data Structure</h3>
            <p>The data structure used to contain information on these tokens in Plasma Chain is called a Sparse Merkle Tree (SMT). Sparse Merkle Trees are efficient because a large part of the hashes used to calculate the root hash of the Merkle Tree remains largely the same, hence these can be pre-calculated and stored, saving computational power during runtime.</p>

            <p>Every token is stored as a leaf on the SMT. A token can always be found at the same position on the SMT and this holds for all blocks since the deposit of the token on the Plasma Chain.</p>

            <hr class="hr-dash my-7">

            <h3 id="validation">Validation</h3>
            <p>When a participant wants to exit from the Plasma Chain, there is a window (currently 7 days) where their exit can be challenged. The participant would reference a particular TokenID and state that proof of ownership of that TokenID entitles them to claim the deposit matched to that TokenID on the root chain.</p>

            <p>Here are two possible ways to challenge an invalid exit:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><span>Exiting on a double-spend: A challenger would give the Merkle Proof of a transaction where the token was already spent. This means that the exiter no longer has ownership to this specific TokenID and this renders the exit invalid.</span></li>

                <li><span>Exiting with another participant’s token: The challenger would be the actual owner of the token and would challenge the exiter to give proof of any transaction showing that the token was indeed spent. If the exiter is unable to give any such proof, it means that the token was not spent and hence still under the ownership of the original owner. This makes the exit invalid since the exiter does not truly own the referenced TokenID.</span></li>
            </ol>

            <hr class="hr-dash my-7">

            <h3 id="application">Application</h3>
            <p>Since proofs of the token’s activity must be shown for every single block from its deposit to the current block, this results in massive overhead when the Plasma Chain has progressed to a significant amount of blocks.</p>

            <p>There is a trade-off between flexibility and fungibility. In Plasma Cash, tokens have to be spent in the exact denomination that they were created in. There is no way to spend less than or a fraction of a specific token in a transaction. This is extremely unsuitable for use cases such as exchanges. There may be certain ways to manage splitting and merging the tokens but these are all highly theoretical and still in discussion.</p>

            <p>Having non-fungible tokens makes Plasma Cash a perfect use case for supply-chain logistics. Each individual part or piece can be tracked as a token. The bulk of the work happens off-chain so the supply chain benefits from the high throughput of the Plasma Chain while the root hashes posted to the Root Chain ensure that the supply chain receives the full security guarantee of Ethereum.</p>
